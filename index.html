    <h1>By A.J.</h1>

    <p>DAY 1<br>
    I have just arrived at the building site. Nothing special, just another ordinary day at work, except that this time I'm getting paid more, and it's coming out of my own pocket, hehe.</p>

    <p>DAY 3<br>
    At the end of the day, my boss sent me to throw away some garbage because everyone else had already left. While I was at the dumpster, I saw a weird-looking object on the ground—a very oddly shaped camera. I took it home and decided I would take pictures on the construction site to keep nice memories with my friends.</p>

    <p>DAY 4<br>
    Something extremely weird happened today. I took a picture of my friend Dave, but after the camera printed the picture, it wasn't Dave in it. It looked nothing like him; it was some kind of creature in the shadows, and I took the picture in the middle of the day! I decided not to show him and to look at the camera at home.</p>

    <p>DAY 10<br>
    For the past few days, I have been taking pictures with the camera, and every time the photo prints, it's nothing like what I took the picture of. It kind of scares me, but I decided I'm going to investigate it further.</p>

    <p>DAY 34<br>
    I'm hearing voices in my sleep, and I'm starting to get paranoid about everything. I don't know who I can trust. I started taking a few pictures a day, but there are just too many pictures, and I don't know where to keep them. I think I might have lost some of them. Where is the camera even getting that paper from? What if it's not paper?</p>

    <p>DAY 36<br>
    My boss is picking up on me not working more than ever. Excuses and apologies barely work. I can't lose my job now, so I decided to leave the camera at home. But I feel strange without it.</p>

    <p>DAY 56?<br>
    I spent the weekend watching movies that could give me an idea of what I'm working with. I decided to call the occurrence "shadow dimension." It feels like I'm taking pictures of something I can't see, but the camera can.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    I was looking over old photos, and I realized that I never took a picture of the same entity twice; every photo is different. What does that mean?</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IS IT A SHAPESHIFTER? ARE THERE MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS? WHERE DID THE CAMERA COME FROM? WHO MADE IT? WHY? STOP TALKING TO ME I'M BUSY WRITING!</p>

    <p>DAY 102<br>
    I came back from the doctor. It wasn't my usual one. Apparently, he was sick. I feel much better and am ready to continue researching the shadow dimension.</p>

    <p>BIRTHDAY<br>
    It used to be very important for me. Today, I spent it alone, trying to research the shadow dimension.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    I think someone wiretapped my house. I decided not to speak about the shadow dimension and say random stuff so they don't suspect much.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    They are spying on me. People are looking at me in public. I hear weird sounds at my house. They know I took the camera; it's the government. They know about this. I think it's some kind of secret project that they've been working on. Is that why they need that base?</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    IT HAS TO BE SOME SECRET ORGANIZATION. I GOT A MAIL FROM MY DOCTOR THAT I SHOULD COME FOR A CHECKOUT, BUT WHEN I TRIED CALLING HIM, HE DID NOT ANSWER. THEY MUST HAVE KILLED HIM AND REPLACED MY DOCTOR WITH THEIR MEMBER TO SPY ON ME.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    I'm losing a lot of pictures; I take at least 10 per day. It makes me feel at home. I hope that the person who finds them will think that they are some stupid art or a joke.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    I SEE THE CONNECTIONS. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE SHADOWS! I SAW THE SAME POSTURE IN THE BACK ON TWO DIFFERENT PICTURES! I CALLED HIM THE PUPPET MASTER. HE MUST BE THE ONE MAKING THOSE CREATURES! HE MUST BE THE ONE! I SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THIS, AND IT WAS THE ONLY THING I FOUND.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    I lost Puppet Master's pictures; I'm devastated. It was my only lead for anything. I'm losing my mind. Was he even there?</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    Every new picture I make gets a name. They are all different. I write their names on the back of the picture. This one is Bob. I love Bob.</p>

    <p>DAY<br>
    We are almost finished with the construction. My coworker asked me if I can take a photo on the opening day. They must have seen me using my camera. I couldn't disagree, but I know it will be another weird monster.</p>

    <p>OPENING DAY<br>
    It's blank.... Why was nothing on the picture? I'm very scared, and the voices stopped. I uploaded all the pictures that I have left on a secure coded site that no one can access except me.</p>
